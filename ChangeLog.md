### Release 2.961 ###
  * I'm not dead

  * Added a ghost
  * (LONG OVERDUE) When Marked for Death by anything other than the FoW, it will now display on the HP cross.
  * Haunted Items now have a proper itemcolor in the backpack. (I know that the TF team has changed it from purple to teal, however I found the new color to be eye-bleedingly bad. As such, I've kept it purple. If you wish to have them be teal, leave a message and I'll make a separate file)
  * Cleaver bar no longer overlaps the sandman!

a.k.a. Merry Almost-Not Christmas!

Christmas break has afforded me the time to fix the class select menu for our good pal Medik, and return it to its former (and much more handsome) glory!

## April 16, 2011 ##
### Release v.2.41 ###
**Hatless update fix!**

  * Fixed broken things so it doesn't crash!
  * Added in support for the new coaching system.
  * Added in button for the new vote system
  * Main menu overhaul is still planned so I literally just slapped on the buttons wherever they'd fit.  Ugly code, ugly menu, I'll fix it later-ish.

## October 02, 2010 ##
### Release v.2.3 ###
**Mann-conomy update fix!**

  * Added a store button to the backpack bar button on the menu
  * Removed the ugly marketing that is the "ITEM OF THE DAY BUY MEEEEEEEEE". If you want to see it, you can still do that by opening the store itself.
  * Positioned the new notification box to a place that makes sense on my main menu. (Many thanks to Soulhaunter for sending me a billion trade requests to test this.)
  * Fixed the newly broken scoreboard
  * REMOVED the custom "Item Get panel" because the old one was crashing the game. This was actually a direct copy from FrankenHUD and it takes WAY too long to re-do this since you can only test it if you get an item. Deal with vanilla, probably wont re-do this.
  * Because of the above, I'd HIGHLY recommend a complete HUD reinstall (delete your resource and scripts folders then install ATH) if you've reinstalled since the update.

### Release v.2.22 ###
Changes are:
  * Inclusion of a new optional Mapper's Toolbar with some features requested by Drexer and the mapping community
  * Scoreboard fixes for a large majority of resolutions, see readme for information.
  * Class you're disguised as now shows up on the Spy disguise bar with appropriate animations
  * Fixes for the new payload maps that include the sliding sections so that you can actually see them on the payload map.
  * Slightly altered the text on the targetIDs to display better on smaller resolutions
  * Changed the "Random Team" button image on the Team Select menu for extra awesome.
  * **Some of the aliases have been minorly changed, please update your autoexec.cfg to what I have in the README!**
  * Maybe something else? I dunno, it's been well over a month since I made most of the changes.

### Release v2.2 ###
  * Switched support from 1440x900 (16:10) resolution to 1366x768 (16:9) due to my new laptop. 16:10 aspect ratios can now eat a big one.
  * Increased border thickness on most of the panels so they even HAVE a border on various resolutions.
  * Further fixes to the [main menu](http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/7035/mainmenuke.png).
  * Took the [MOTD](http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/9067/motdfp.png), [map info](http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/3672/mapinfo.png) and [item find](http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/863/itemgetm.png) panels from FrankenHUD.
  * New [team select](http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9940/teammenu.png) menu.
  * New [class select](http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/8428/classmenu.png) menu (based off the one on FrankenHUD, made 10x better).
  * Added the map name to the scoreboard because I was reminded to :X.
  * Lopped off the "time left" portion of the server time on the scoreboard. Chances are I messed something up for different resolutions.
  * Added drop shadows to various things in the engineer's building panel.  Should be easier to read the text at least, icons were a no-go.

### July 09, 2010 ###
#### Release v2.12 ####
  * Multiple changes to the main menu including adding several "magic buttons" to it (thanks again G-Mang), as well as changing the color theme to match the new dark theme TF2 is sporting.  Might stay, might not, just testing it.

  * The "magic buttons" in the "Find Server" button bar do as listed:
    * The 1, 2, and 3 buttons connect to your favorite servers.  See [this page](http://code.google.com/p/toastyhudtf2/wiki/autoexec) for information on making these buttons work.
    * The "home" button next to the 1, 2, and 3 buttons does the same thing, but it's reserved for your match server or whatever you feel like.
  * In the lower right clusters are these three new buttons:
    * The first runs "record fix; stop" in order to reload models and animations (NOTE: It **will** stop demos in progress!)
    * The second runs "hud\_reloadscheme" to, uh, reload your HUD to fix any bugs with it for when watching STV and such.
    * The third, and final, toggles between cl\_hudminmode 0 and 1 to toggle between the small and large timers.  This one requires you to use the code on [this page](http://code.google.com/p/toastyhudtf2/wiki/autoexec) as well.

  * Moved the server name in the scoreboard to cut off the "Server:" bit like I did for the time left.

  * Moved the Engineer's new revenge crits counter to the right of the metal count and added the new kill count icon as a background to it.

  * Updated the engineer's building panel to include all of Valve's recent changes.  Much better now.

### June 12, 2010 ###
#### Release v2.11 ####
  * Fixed the broken KOTH timers due to the update
  * Fixed and slimmed down the new main menu to be <a href='http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/6166/newmainmenufath.png'>less ugly</a>
  * Added option to add buttons on the main menu that connect you directly to the ubercharged.net servers.  See readme for more info.
  * Re-added the 4x3 Tournament Spectator Fix into the download.  I'm retarded, forgive me.

---

### May 27, 2010 ###
#### Release v2.1 ####
  * Bleed icon added
  * Fixed CTF panel on hybrid gametypes after playing on the new CTF maps from tf2maps.net
  * More compact and prettier quickswitch menu
  * Fixed another TargetID alignment issue
  * Added tick marks to most of the charge bars. Had people yelling at me to add them after Gmang released his HUD.
  * Tweaks to the scoreboard and death notices, as well as the build, destroy and disguise menus.

---

### May 5, 2010 ###
#### Patch v2.01 ####
