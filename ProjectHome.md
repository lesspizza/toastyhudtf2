This started out as a little side project of mine to combine Essobie's center based minimalistic approach with a dash of style from Flame's HUD.  I personally found them too far to the extreme in both directions so I took it upon myself to find a happy medium and tweak it to my liking.  There actually isn't much left that looks like either, but you'll notice 'em if you see 'em.

Note: Screenshots on the wiki page aren't guaranteed to be completely up to date, but anything you see on this main page is.  I'm lazy, bite me.

You should join the [Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/toastyhudtf2) so you can always be up to date on when I update!  :D

---

## December 26. 2012 ##

## October 26, 2012 ##
### Release 2.95 ###
  * Now with 35% more spooky!
  * Updated the status panels for Wave 666
  * The Wheel of Fate effect will now display to the right of your health
  * Added a ghost
  * (LONG OVERDUE) When Marked for Death by anything other than the FoW, it will now display on the HP cross.
  * Haunted Items now have a proper itemcolor in the backpack. (I know that the TF team has changed it from purple to teal, however I found the new color to be eye-bleedingly bad. As such, I've kept it purple. If you wish to have them be teal, leave a message and I'll make a separate file)
  * Cleaver bar no longer overlaps the sandman!

Note: The only files changed are /resource ClientScheme.res and resource/ui HudItemEffectMeter\_Cleaver. If you have modifications you have saved, these should be the only ones you need to replace
